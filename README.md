# Crowdfunding_ETL

# General Information
Using two datasets, crowdfunding campaign and contacts. Using Python dictionaries and regular expressions to create four different dataframes: Category, Subcategory, Contacts and Campaign. Then cleaning the data by checking data types, column names and reordering. After saving the finalized dataframes as csv file, I sketched an ERD and created a database schema. The schema was used to create tables in Postgresql where the csv files of the dataframe were imported.
